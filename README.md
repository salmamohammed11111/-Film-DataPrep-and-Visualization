🎬 Film DataPrep & Visualization   
This project explores a movie dataset using Python to uncover insights through data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualizations. It demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and storytelling with visuals.   

📌 Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates.
- Exploratory Analysis: Investigated relationships between budget, revenue, genres, and ratings.
- Visualizations: Created insightful plots using Seaborn and Plotly to highlight trends and outliers.
- Interactivity: Enhanced user engagement with dynamic charts for deeper exploration.
  
  🔍 What Was Done — In Detail
  
- Data Ingestion & Initial Assessment  
 Imported the dataset using Pandas, followed by an initial structure audit. Identified key issues including null values, irrelevant columns, inconsistent data types, and unstructured      categorical data.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Replaced and removed missing or duplicate entries using targeted filters.
- Converted data types (e.g., dates and numeric strings) to appropriate formats for analysis.
- Standardized and simplified string formats for genres and cast names.
- Filtered out records with clearly incomplete or unrealistic values (e.g., zero budgets and revenues).
- Feature Selection & Statistical Exploration
Selected relevant features for analysis — such as budget, revenue, vote_average, and genres.
Conducted descriptive statistics and explored outliers, skewness, and inter-feature correlations using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Evaluated how genre popularity, revenue, and ratings change over time.
- Assessed relationships between budget and financial return.
- Analyzed how vote averages vary across genres and production scales.
Insights were derived both numerically and visually, with clear annotations.
- Data Visualization
Created a series of high-impact visualizations to communicate findings, including:
- Bar Charts for genre distribution and vote averages
- Scatter Plots comparing budget vs. revenue across decades
- Boxplots illustrating rating dispersion by genre
- Interactive Visuals using Plotly for user engagement and drill-down capability

  📊 Sample Visuals
- Genre distribution bar chart
- Budget vs. Revenue scatter plot
- Top-rated films by popularit

  🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
  This project leveraged a range of powerful tools and libraries to ensure a robust and insightful analysis:
- Python 3.x – Primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Pandas – For efficient data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and tabular analysis.
- NumPy – Supported numerical operations and array-based transformations.
- Seaborn – Created attractive and informative static visualizations for statistical exploration.
- Matplotlib – Provided foundational plotting capabilities and customization for visuals.
- Plotly Express – Enabled interactive charts with drill-down capabilities for deeper storytelling.
- Jupyter Notebook – Served as the interactive development environment for combining code, visuals, and narrative.

  📈 Insights & Reflection
Through this project, I uncovered several key patterns within the film industry landscape:
- Genre Dynamics: Action and Drama were the most prevalent genres, yet Comedy and Animation often showed higher average ratings, especially in recent years.
- Budget vs. Revenue: While a general positive correlation exists, several outliers revealed that a large budget doesn’t guarantee success, and some low-budget films achieved remarkable returns.
- Vote Average Trends: Genre and production size influence audience ratings, with niche or critically acclaimed films often outperforming big-budget blockbusters in average scores.
Beyond the data, this project strengthened my ability to:
- Design a full analytical pipeline — from raw CSV to storytelling-ready visuals.
- Balance static and interactive visualizations to suit different audience needs.
- Troubleshoot real-world data issues like missing values, misclassified data types, and skewed distributions.
This analysis deepened my understanding of how visualizations can amplify insights — not just display them — and reinforced the importance of curiosity-driven exploration alongside technical precision.
